        text: `I know I've walked too far
But when I look at the path
It still remains the same from the start
I donâ€™t know where my brightness is
What I know is I have to cross this darkness on my own
Maybe thinking of the past is making me feel like I did not come this far
But excitement of the future is still making me roam the path
Maybe I got distracted while moving ahead
But all the distractions dropped me at the exact position where I belong
Not knowing where to go ahead
But I can see a tinge of light waiting for me to see the whole new world ahead.`,
        message: "Sometimes, we lose sight of how far we've come, Ridsss. But your words reflect the light thatâ€™s always been within you. Even in darkness, you shine gently forward â€” just like you always do."

      {
        text: `No matter how much we want to hold onto something
But what is supposed to get slipped out will get our hold off
We may feel like we're losing everything in life
But never ever let go of that little hope
Hope that stays in your heart and lights up like the golden hour of sunset
We may see darkness all over the place
But we can identify the obstacles if we want to fight back
Struggle is what makes a person stronger and a fighter
And not giving up is the sign of it
So letâ€™s get up and fight back
Because no darkness can defeat us if we have faith and hope within ourselves.`,

        text: `Recently, life taught me that sometimes, the less you know, the better.
Life's smooth, how it manipulated me to leave what I love the most,
It showed me that the smaller your circle is, the more comfortable you become.
The less you worry, the happier you are.
Life has taken a turn where I no longer feel a sense of belonging.
I try to find the right road to take, only to realize there's no such thing as the "right" road.
You have to create your own path,
A path where you belong,
Where there's no fear of judgment, no sense of being out of place,
A place you can truly call your own.
It's important to build that comfort space,
Somewhere you can retreat when life is too harsh for too long.
Because life will keep throwing you deeper and deeper into the well.
And it's you who will have to climb out, again and again.
That's how you overcome life,
By rising every time, and becoming the version of yourself you truly want to be.`,
        message: "Ridsss, your words build sanctuaries â€” not just for you, but for anyone who's ever felt lost. You're not just surviving lifeâ€™s turns; you're carving a beautiful, brave path out of them."
